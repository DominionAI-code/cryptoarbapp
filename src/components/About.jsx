        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-yellow-500 mb-6">What is Crypto Arbitrage?</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          Cryptocurrency arbitrage is a strategy that takes advantage of price differences between exchanges. As
          cryptocurrency prices can vary between exchanges due to market inefficiencies, arbitrageurs buy low on one
          exchange and sell high on another. This creates an opportunity for risk-free profit, provided you act
          quickly and have access to accurate, real-time data.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4 text-lg">
          With CryptoArb, we simplify the process by automatically tracking price differences and giving you the
          data you need to seize profitable opportunities before they vanish.
